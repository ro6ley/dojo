# Project - Andela Office Space Allocation  

When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if
they choose to opt in.
When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only.
This project will digitize and randomize a room allocation system for one of
Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.
This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The requirements are in the file

```
requirements.txt
```

### Installing

Install python in your system if you don't have it yet (Why though?)
```
$ sudo apt install python
```

Clone the repo:
HTTPS
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ro6ley/dojo.git
```
SSH
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ro6ley/dojo.git
```

Change Directory into the project folder
```
$ cd dojo
```

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.5
```
$ virtualenv --python=python3.5 env
```

Activate the virtual environment you have just created
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install the application's dependencies from requirements.txt to the virtual environment
```
$ (env) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the tool in interactive mode:
```
$ (env) python main.py -i
```

Usage:
```
    create_room <room_type> <room_name>...
